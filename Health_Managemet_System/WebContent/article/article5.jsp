			<P>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder in women. Failure to diagnose and treat PCOS can lead to metabolic disorders that affect the reproductory system and cause infertility.  But if it is screened and detected early, PCOS can be tackled successfully. </P>
			
			<P>Studies reveal that 5.9 percent of the women in the Gampaha district suffer from PCOS, while 10-25 percent of women of reproductive age globally suffer from PCOS.</P>

			<p>What causes irregular periods?

Irregular periods are caused by enlarged ovaries that contain numerous follicles (small collections of fluid) which surround your eggs. These prevent your ovaries from functioning properly, and in some cases lead to infertility. This is in addition to elevated levels of the male hormone (androgen), which result in excessive facial and body hair, along with severe acne and male-pattern baldness. </p>
			
			<p>These symptoms can become more aggressive if a woman is obese. PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance which leads to an increased risk of health problems later in life, such as Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure.</p>
			 
			 <P>How PCOS impacts mental health

PCOS sufferers are about three times more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety and depression than people without PCOS, with many reporting severe bouts of anxiety and depression. It is also associated with an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and eating disorders.

A personâ€™s values, lifestyle and culture will either ease or aggravate specific symptoms. For example, the negative stigma attached to infertility in the Sri Lankan culture may lead many women affected by PCOS to severe depression. Overall, many report feeling frustrated and anxious about their lack of control over their health and body.</P>
			 
			 <P>PCOS interrupts the normal menstrual cycle and makes conception more difficult. Around 70-80 percent of women with the condition have fertility problems. It can also increase pregnancy-related complications and miscarriages. However, it is important to note that having PCOS does not mean that a person can never get pregnant. Weight loss and other treatments can improve your chance of getting pregnant since PCOS is treatable.</P>
