			<P>Lockdowns, isolation, quarantine, daily infection rate, death rates, vaccines, food deliveries, etc, has dominated our lives in the last year. 
			Covid 19 has certainly taken the lives of many people and many, many more have fallen ill. But beyond that it has taken a toll on all other people, 
			in the form of mental anxiety as well as physical health. </P>
			
			<P>So what can each person do to bring themselves to a better state of health and wellness to withstand the
			 pandemic and quickly recover as we come out of the pandemic?</P>

			<p>The illness enters the body through the nose, eyes, or mouth, and then proceeds to the lungs. This is why we 
			are advised to avoid touching your face or to be in crowded situations in which particles expelled through coughing and sneezing might be inhaled. 
			Also to wear a mask that covers our nose as well as our mouth while out and around others. Keeping a distance while interacting with others.
			And regularly washing or sanitizing your hands if you are out and handling money, people and in public </p>
			
			<p>Most people who get COVID 19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. If you are tested positive but feel well, stay calm and seek instructions from your family doctor via telephone and area PHI/ MOH.
			 Stay home and stay in a separate room from others in the house.</p>
			 
			 <P>After vaccination you still need to remain vigilant and follow distancing, sanitizing, and wearing a mask. 
			 Why? Until at least 60 to 70% of the population is vaccinated, it’s still possible to continue to transmit and get Covid infection even 
			 after vaccination. Although those who are vaccinated would be less likely to fall terribly sick. But you could transmit to those who are not 
			 yet vaccinated. Also, the covid 19 variants may still be able to escape the vaccination safety net. So being careful is still needed until much 
			 more people are vaccinated. It is imperative to have a faster vaccination drive</P>
			 
			 <P>Despite everything, mankind has beaten many odds, and beating this pandemic should not be hard if everyone stays smart and strong. 
			 Follow the science, don’t propagate false information. 
			 And use the advancing technologies such as telemedicine, apps, delivery services to ensure you are always connected.</P>
