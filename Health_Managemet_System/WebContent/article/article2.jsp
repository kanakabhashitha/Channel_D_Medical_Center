			<P>Being confined indoors, how many of us are struggling with weight changes, stress, and an uncertain predicament? 
			I am one of the many who happens to be juggling between working from home, 
			eat from home, workout from home, shopping from home, and home-school kids too!  </P>
			
			<P>We all thought it was short-term and that we could cope with this setback but the reality is proving to be otherwise.
			 Covid brought forth abrupt changes to day-to-day schedules which led to a couch potato lifestyle alteration for the majority. 
			Amidst all the mental and physical challenges that come our way, it’s up to us to decide what needs to be done. </P>

			<p>Well, the only good news about this whole virus thing is that we are all in this together and that is reason enough 
			to take control of our health. While immunity is our prime concern today, I feel we should prioritize weight management too as this would certainly enhance immunity against disease and improve recovery due to illness or injury. If we could ask ourselves, 
			‘What can I do with what I’ve got?’ instead of saying, ‘I’m not going to be able to…’, then we can surely turn things around! </p>
			
			<p>A survey done by King’s Hospital, UK showed that 48 percent of the respondents from their survey had put on weight during the lockdown. 
			In particular, experts believe being obese leads to the reduction of adiponectin, a substance that protects the lungs. Also, Rundle et al. hypothesized that increased unstructured time during the current COVID-19 pandemic will exacerbate obesity risk factors in children. 
			I suppose, whether it's kids or teens or adults or even our pets - we are all in a pickle.</p>
			 
			 <P>Lack of sleep, decreased physical activity, snacking after dinner, stockpiling as a safety measure, 
			 eating because of stress or plain boredom or simply because of ready access (a tiptoe to the fridge perhaps!), 
			 are behaviors linked to weight gain. Stress also seems to affect food preferences. Numerous studies have shown that physical 
			 or emotional distress increases the intake of food high in fat, sugar, or both. High cortisol levels, in combination with high insulin levels, may be responsible.
			  Other research suggests that ghrelin, a "hunger hormone," may have a role in erratic eating patterns.</P>
			 
			 <P>So get the recommended amount of sleep, do not snack when not needed, figure out your stress triggers, be mindful of your food cravings, and be prepared. 
			 Stay away from your scale - the number on it does not define you. Fish out the right resources available to you.</P>
